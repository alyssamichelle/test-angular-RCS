# It looks like order is important in regards to styles.scss and your Kendo styles. Check out [Emma's fix here](https://github.com/twerske/test-angular-RCS/commit/c5f86b4208a110ee1adb1388bf492790b463389c).

This is the Angular Tour of Heroes app with Kendo UI for Angular added in. I replaced the default heroes with MLP characters for added fun!
